# Bayes-classifier-as-multivariate-Gaussian

Problem Statement

With the data we wish to classify the type of glass among the 3 possible types(1,2,7) given. To do this we divide the
data set randomly into a training and test set.
(a) Using the training data build a Bayes classifier where you model the class-conditional distributions as
multivariate Gaussian on the 9 predictive variables.
(b) Test the classifier on the test set and compute the error rate.
(c) Test the classifier on the training set as well and compute the error rate.
